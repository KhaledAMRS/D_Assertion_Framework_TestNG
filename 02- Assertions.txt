2- Assertions		 // to announce test case status pass/fail depending on the comparison between actual and expected result true/false


2.1- AssertTrue, AssertFalse
	
	input1 for comparison
	input2 as a Message  
	
	Notes: 
	- input1 data type should be boolean
	- input2 is only printed in console if the test case failed, but if the test case pass > the message will not be printed



	- AssertEqual, AssertNotEqual
	
	input1 for actualResult
	input2 for expectedResult
	input3 for Message 
	
	
	Notes: 
	- input1 & input2 data type's could be anyting String, Int, boolean, double, char, etc (unlike assertTrue/False) 
	- input1 & input2 should have the same data type  [ means: if input1 is String, then input2 should be String and so on but it's wrong that input1 is String and input2 is Int]
	- input3 is only printed in console if the test case failed, but if the test case pass > the message will not be printed


There are other assertions but it's rarely to be used  
        Assert.assertEqualsDeep();
		Assert.assertEqualsNoOrder();
		etc		



2.2- Difference between Hard/Soft Annotation

    - Hard Assertion		>>		doesn't need new object
    - Soft Assertion		>>		should create new object 


Hard Assert: If assert condition gets failed
1. TestNG throws an exception immediately after the assert fails
2. The remaining statements inside the method will be aborted.
3. TestNG carries out with the next test case of the suite. 


Soft Assert: If assert condition gets failed
1. TestNG collects errors during execution and doesnâ€™t throws an exception immediately.
2. If there is any exception and you want to throw it then you need to use assertAll() method as a last statement
3. TestNG will carry out with the next test case of the suite. 


Note: unlike Annotations, you should learn Assertions very well because we will use it with Cucumber as well
